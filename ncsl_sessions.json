Please note: Shuttles will run from BCEC to the USS Constitution from 5-6 p.m. Shuttles will not run between hotels and the USS Constitution. Return shuttles will not be available. Board the USS Constitution | 5:30-8:30 p.m. Board the world’s oldest commissioned warship still afloat, a rare chance to step onto a piece of living history from the War of 1812. Nicknamed \"Old Ironsides\" for its strong oak hull that repelled British cannon fire, the ship now serves as an active-duty Navy vessel, stationed at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston. The experience brings to life over 200 years of naval heritage while offering stunning views of Boston Harbor. A tour not to be missed! Board the Cassin Young at the Charlestown Navy Yard | 5:30-7:30 p.m. The USS Cassin Young (DD-793) is a Fletcher-class destroyer of the U.S. Navy named for Captain Cassin Young (1894-1942) who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism at the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and killed in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in the fall of 1942. The destroyer was launched Sept. 12, 1943, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986 as one of only four surviving Fletcher-class destroyers still afloat. In addition to the tour, a representative from the National Park Service Engagement with National Park Service rangers will talk about the history of the National Park.",
